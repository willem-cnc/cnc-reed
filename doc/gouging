Gouging uses variables

reed parameters
_i-radius            radius for the inside
_i-thickness         thickness in the center
_i-sink-z            distance reed is below carrier surface
_i-width             the width of the reed
_i-delta-z           difference in z for low and high y (normally 0)
_gouge-steps         number of gouging actions

The program (called by inside) does
- calculate x step size
- loops with different x
   - calculate z
   - makes line with low x
   - makes line with high x
