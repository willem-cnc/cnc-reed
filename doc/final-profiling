Final profiling uses variables
cp-x              0 x value in point store element
cp-z              1 z value in point store element
cp-s              2 element size in point store

Reed parameters
_first-p          first element of profile table
_last-p           last element of profile table
_m-y              0  element distance from bottom of reed
_m-x              1  half with of the model
_m-s              10 element size 
_p-ra             3  rail thickness
_p-ch             4  channel thickness
_p_ce             5  center thickness
_p-cal            6  number of calculation points rail-channel and channel-center
_p-steps          7  number of final profile steps per element
_point-store      location for storing calculation points

The program (called by blade) does
   for each element (first to last)
      - for each step
         calculate x,y, thickness rail, channel & center
         for each calculation point rail-channel & channelcenter
            calculate and store x, z
         for each element in point store
            - mill point-store from right to center
            - mill point-store from right to left
            or
            - mill point-store from left to center
            - mill point-store from center to tight

p-steps are the number of y increments within a single element
      so you can make the steps variable 
p-cal are the number of calculation point between
      rail-channel and channel-center within a single element
      so you can adjust these to the witdth of the model
      tip (high y) is wider then start of blade (lower y)
