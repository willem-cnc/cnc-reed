Modelling uses variables

safe-z         z value to stay free of the reed 

reed parameters
_first-m       first element of the parameter list
_last-m        last element of the parameter list
_m-y           y value for the element
_m-x           half width of the reed at _m-y
_m-s           element size

The program (called by inside) does
- on low x side
   - loop elements form first to last
   - loop elements from last to first with corrected y value
- on high x side
   - loop elements from first to last with corrected y value
   - loop elements frome last to first
