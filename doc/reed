Named reed files are possible. Before starting inside or blade a link
has to be made. 
The link name: reed.ngc
The reference: the named file

There are 3 reed files named after the source 
davidsson.ngc
ewell.ngc
stees.ngc

A reed file is contructed as a subroutine after calling the routine the
variables are global defined #<_name> = value.

The variables
_reed-length      length of the reed
_scratch-size     space for clamps (extra reed length at both sides)
_i-width          width of quarter round reed
_i-radius         gouging radius = radius profile carrier
_i-thickness      thickness middle of the reed
_gouge-steps      number of rounds for gouging
_b-start-angle    profiling (raw) start angle
_b-ange-step      profiling (raw) angle step

_gouge-flag       call gouging (0 = no, 1= yes)
_model-flag       call modelling (0 = no, 1= yes)
_raw-flag         call profiling-raw (0 = no, 1= yes)
_final-flag       call profiling-final (0 = no, 1= yes)

The model and profile tables are combined and consists of elements

_first-m          first element of model table
_last-m           last element of model table
_first-p          first element of profile table
_last-p           last element of profile table
_m-s              10 element size 

Indexes in an element
_m-y              0  element distance from bottom of reed
_m-x              1  half with of the model
_p-z              2  thickness for raw
_p-ra             3  rail thickness
_p-ch             4  channel thickness
_p-ce             5  center thickness
_p-cal            6  number of calculation points rail-channel and
                     channel-center
_p-steps          7  number of final profile steps per element

_point-store      location for storing calculation points
                  2 x max _p-cal is used
