Parameters

   All programs are using a part of these parameters.

Machine parameters

   All programs are using coordinate system 1. The file „machine.ngc”
   defines the machine coordinates (mm with 3 decimals). The file is
   constructed as subroutine and is called by the programs. After the
   call these parameters are defined. 

   #<_x-touch>       x coordinate on touch plate
      used by: change-tool
   #<_y-touch>       y coordinate on touch plate
      used by: change-tool
   #<_z-touch>       head without tool
      used by: change-tool

   #<_pz-origin>     top profileroll

   #<_z-probe>      tool z for iz-origin & pz-origin          
      used by:  carrier-inside, gouging, modelling
                profile-screws, profiling-sb, profiling-db

   #<_pipe-radius>   outside radius reed pipe

   #<_b-radius>      radius profileroll
      used by:  gouging, profiling-sb, profiling-db
   #<_bed-length>    length of gouging bed
      used by:  carrier-inside
   #<_scratch-size>  space for gouging clips
      used by:  carrier-inside
   #<_gouge-length>  length between clamps
      used by:  gouging
   #<_reed-length>   length of the final reed
      used by:  modelling, profile-screws
   #<_i-sink-z>      depth in gouging carrier
      used by:  carrier-inside, gouging
   #<_i-delta-z>     difference z front/back
      used by:  carrier-inside, gouging
   #<_i-delta-x>     difference x front/back
      used by: gouging

Reed parameters

   All programs are using reed parameters. The file "reed.ngc" defines
   the reed parameters. The file is constructed as subroutine and is
   called by the programs. After the call these parameters are defined.
   You can make a link too a named file with ln -sf definition.ngc 
   reed.ngc. (ln -sf stees.ngc reed.ngc).

   #<_i-radius>      gouging radius = radius profileroll
      used by:  gouging, profiling-sb, profiling-db
   #<_i-thickness>   thickness in the center for gouging
      used by:  gouging
   #<_gouge-steps>   number of steps for gouging
      used by:  gouging
   #<_big-gouge>     width for blade gouge block (if < small-gouge => gouging full length)
      used by:  gouging
   #<_small-gouge>   width for shaft gouge block
      used by:  gouging
   #<_blade-block>   start y for blade block
      used by:  gouging
   #<_b-start-angle> angle first profileline (frontview profileroll)
      used by:  profiling-sb
   #<_b-angle-step>  degrees next profileline 
      used by:  profiling-sb
   #<_point-store>   value for table with profile calculation points
      used by:  profiling-db

   The next table is a list of elements for a combination of model and profile elements. 

   #<_first-m>       value of first model element
      used by:  modelling
   #<_last-m>        value of last model element
      used by:  modelling
   #<_first-p>       value of fist profile element (>= first-m)
      used by:  profiling-sb, profiling-db
   #<_last-p>        value of last profile element (<= last-m)
      used by:  profiling-sb, profiling-db

   Each element contains these parameters - () is element index
   #<_m-y> (0)       y value of the element
      used by:  modelling, profiling-sb, profiling-db
   #<_m-x> (1)       half width of the model for this y
      used by:  modelling, profiling-db
   #<_p-z> (2)       thickness for this y
      used by:  profing-sb
   #<_p-ra> (3)      rail thickness for this y 
      used by:  profiling-db
   #<_p-ch> (4)      channel thickness for this y
      used by:  profiling-db
   #<_p-ce> (5)      center thickness for this y
      used by:  profiling-db
   #<_p-cal> (6)     number of calculationpoints center-channel and channel-rail
      used by:  profiling-db
   #<_p-steps> (7)   number of y increments too m-y of next element
      used by:  profiling-db
   #<_m-s> (10)      element size (rounded on 10 for readability)
      used by:  modelling, profile-screws, profiling-sb, profiling-db

   center is the middle of the reed
   channel is middle between center and rail
   rail is the x value of the element
