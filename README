As a non-professional bassoon player in a wind orchestra I made
my reeds by hand for about 30 years. I used gouges, stanley knives, 
sandpaper and a lot of patience.

The problem is that the results are different every time so I looked
for a (low cost) repeatable process. End 2017 I found on youtube a
movie of hipperbassoon which shows the construction of a reedblade with
a dremel cutter by copying a model.

The idea was to do the same with a cnc-machine without a model. At that
time I did not have a cnc-machine or knowledge how to programm it.
I'm a retired programmer and all my home systems are build by myself
with debian linux, so linuxcnc and g-code fits in this picture.

The final process:
1. split the reed pipe in 4 pieces
2. cut it to desired length
3. cnc-milling for gouging
4. cnc-milling for modelling
5. cnc-milling for profiling
6. rest is standard

My hardware consists off:
- pipe splitter
   4 knives
   4 quarter round 7 mm
   4 aluminium stops
   1 multiplex plate
- computer
   - Intel D945GCLF2 with ATOM 330 1.6 GHz (1 core disabled)
   - RAM 2 GB
   - SSD Crucial 120GB
- milling machine
   - designed with freecad and build with aluminium (based on grabcad model)
- gouching carrier
   - 20x20 aluminium profile
- profiling carrier
   - 20x20 aluminium profile
   - aluminium pipe D=26
- touch plate
   - iron key plate

The software consists off:
- linuxcnc
   RTAI kernel (amd64)
- machine.ngc
   properties of the machine
   locations and dimensions
      - of gouging carrier
      - of profiling carrier
      - of tool probe
- reed.ngc or link to a named-reed file
   parameters of a reed
   gouging, modelling and profiling
- inside.ngc
   setup for gouging and modelling
   start do_inside and/or do_model
- do_gouge.ngc
   gouging using reed parameters
- do_model.ngc
   modelling using reed parameters
- blade_screws.ngc
   screw setting for reed positioning
- blade.ngc
   setup for profiling
   start do_blade_raw and/or do_blade_final
- do_blade_raw.ngc
   first step profiling in length of blade
- do_blade_final.ngc
   second step profiling transverse of blade
- change_tool.ngc
   request tool mount and measure tool length
