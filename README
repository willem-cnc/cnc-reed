As a non-professional bassoon player in a wind orchestra I made
my reeds by hand for about 30 years. I used gouges, stanley knives, 
sandpaper and a lot of patience.

The problem is that the results are different every time so I looked
for a (low cost) repeatable process. End 2017 I found on youtube a
movie of hipperbassoon which shows the construction of a reedblade with
a dremel cutter by copying a model.

The idea was to do the same with a cnc-machine without a model. At that
time I did not have a cnc-machine or knowledge how to programm it.
I'm a retired programmer and all my home systems are build by myself
with debian linux, so linuxcnc and g-code fits in this picture.

The final process:
1. split the reed pipe in 4 pieces
2. cut it to desired length
3. cnc-milling for gouging
4. cnc-milling for modelling
5. cnc-milling for profiling
6. rest is standard

My hardware consists off:
- pipe splitter
   4 knives
   4 quarter round 7 mm
   4 aluminium stops
   1 multiplex plate
- computer
   - Intel D945GCLF2 with ATOM 330 1.6 GHz (1 core disabled)
   - RAM 2 GB
   - SSD Crucial 120GB
- milling machine
   - designed with freecad and build with aluminium (based on grabcad model)
- gouging/modelling carrier
   - 20x20 aluminium profile
   - wooden plate with bed for reed
- profiling carrier
   - 20x20 aluminium profile
   - aluminium pipe D=26
- touch plate
   - iron key plate

The software consists off:
- linuxcnc 2.8.2
   RTAI kernel (amd64)
- machine.ngc
   properties of the machine
   locations and dimensions of:
      - gouging carrier
      - profiling carrier
      - tool probe
- reed.ngc or link to a named-reed file
   parameters of a reed
   gouging and profiling
   herzberg.ngc as example
- model.ngc or link to a named-model file
   parameters for modelling
   example for model in model.ngc
- gouging.ngc
   gouging using reed parameters
- modelling.ngc
   modelling using reed parameters
- profile-screws.ngc
   screw setting for reed positioning
- profiling-db.ngc
   profiling like a double barrel profiler
- profiling-sb.ngc
   profiling like a single barrel profiler
- change-tool.ngc
   request tool mount and measure tool length
- carrier-inside.ngc
   creates the reedbed for gouging/modelling
