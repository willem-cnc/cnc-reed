As a non-professional bassoon player in a wind orchestra I made
my reeds by hand for about 30 years. I used gouges, stanley knives, 
sandpaper and a lot of patience.

The problem is that the results are different every time so I looked
for a (low cost) repeatable process. End 2017 I found on youtube a
movie of hipperbassoon which shows the construction of a reedblade with
a dremel cutter by copying a model.

The idea was to do the same with a cnc-machine without a model. At that
time I did not have a cnc-machine or knowledge how to programm it.
I'm a retired programmer and all my home systems are build by myself
with debian linux, so linuxcnc and g-code fits in this picture.

I build a cnc machine with aluminum parts and did a lot of tests.
The cnc machine is then updated so the y-block is more robust and the
carriers are no longer part of the machine construction and mounted on
the y-block. Also the portal is fixed in x and y direction with wooden
strips.

After a period of manual pre-gouging the gouging program is adjusted
with 2 phases of pre-gouging.

The single and double barrel profiling programs are combined, the
separate processes are selectable in the reed parameter file.

The reed parameter file is extended for these adjustments.

The final process:
1. split the reed pipe in 4 pieces
2. cut it to desired length (140 mm)
3. cnc-milling for gouging
4. cut it 120 mm
5. manual modelling
6. sand the inside
7. cnc-milling for profiling
8. rest is standard

My hardware consists off:
- knive for splitting pipes
- computer
   - Intel D945GCLF2 with ATOM 330 1.6 GHz (1 core disabled)
   - RAM 2 GB
   - SSD Crucial 120GB
- milling machine
   - designed with freecad and build with aluminium (based on grabcad model)
- gouging/modelling carrier
   - 20x20 aluminium profile
   - wooden plate with bed for reed
- profiling carrier
   - 20x20 aluminium profile
   - aluminium pipe D=25
- touch plate
   - iron key plate

The software consists off:
- linuxcnc 2.9.4
   RTAI kernel (amd64)
- machine.ngc
   properties of the machine
   locations and dimensions of:
      - gouging carrier
      - profiling carrier
      - tool probe
- reed.ngc or link to a named-reed file
